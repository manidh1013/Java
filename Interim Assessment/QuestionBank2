Q 42: Sam works as a programmer in Xyz Company and he created the following program to read 
data from a
file:
import java.io.*; 
class Rose { 
public static void main (String args[]) { 
try{ 
FileReader f= new FileReader("abd.txt"); 
BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(f); 
String str; 
while((str=br.readLine())!=null) { 
System.out.println(str ); 
} 
}catch(FileNotFoundException ce) { 
ce.printStackTrace(); 
} 
catch(IOException e) { 
System.out.println("Hi"); 
} 
} 
} 
Which of the following exception will be generated when the specified file is not available?
A. NoClassDefFoundException B. FileNotFoundException
C. EOFException D. IllegalArguementException
A 42: Option B is the correct answer
Q 43: Sam works as a programmer in Xyz Company and he created the following program:
class Rose { 
public static void main (String args[]) { 
// write appropriate code here 
switch(k) { 
case 65: System.out.println("hello"); 
case 'k': System.out.println("Hi"); 
case 'j': System.out.println("Java"); 
break; 
default: System.out.println("default");} 
} 
} 
You have to choose appropriate code snippet from the following code snippets to replace the “// 
write
appropriate code here” statement in the preceding program so that “hello Hi Java” can be printed:
A. int k = 65 B. char k= (char) 65;
C. char k=’A’ D. int k =’65’
A 43: Options B and C are the correct answers
